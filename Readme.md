# 🌿 Plant Disease Detection App

A deep learning-based image classifier designed to detect plant diseases from leaf images using a fine-tuned MobileNetV2 model. Deployed as a user-friendly Streamlit web application, it allows users to upload images and receive instant diagnostic predictions with visual explanations.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

Plant diseases cause significant agricultural losses globally. Early and accurate detection can help mitigate these issues. This project automates the classification of plant diseases from images, enabling farmers and researchers to act quickly and prevent widespread crop damage.

---

## 🚀 Features

- **Fine-tuned MobileNetV2** for efficient and accurate disease classification
- **Image preprocessing**: resizing, normalization, and optional augmentation
- **Visual explanations** using Grad-CAM to highlight regions influencing predictions
- **Streamlit interface**: upload leaf images and view real-time results
- Support for **multiple plant species** as per the dataset
- Optional **downloadable reports** or prediction history (if enabled)

## 🔧 Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Git
- pip or conda
- (Optional) Virtual environment tool (`venv`, `virtualenv`, or `conda`)

---

## 🛠 Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Hassan0-51/Plant-Disease-Detection.git
````

2. **Navigate into the directory**

   ```bash
   cd Plant-Disease-Detection
   ```
3. **Create and activate a virtual environment** (recommended)

   ```bash
   # Linux/macOS
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate

   # Windows (PowerShell)
   python -m venv venv
   .\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
   ```
4. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

---

## 🚀 Usage

1. **Download or place model weights** in `models/` (e.g., `mobilenetv2_finetuned.h5`).
2. **Run the Streamlit app**

   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```
3. **Open the URL** shown in the terminal (e.g., `http://localhost:8501`).
4. **Upload a leaf image**: view the predicted class, confidence score, and Grad-CAM overlay.

## 🛠️ Development

* **Branching**: use feature branches and merge via pull requests.
* **Linting & formatting**: consider `black` and `flake8`.
* **Testing**: add unit tests in `tests/` and run with `pytest`.
* **CI/CD**: optionally configure GitHub Actions for automated testing.

---

## 📈 Evaluation

* Track metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.
* Save training curves and evaluation reports in `reports/`.
